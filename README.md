# Ode to Joy - MIDI Practice

This project is to learn MIDI creation analysis. It explores Beethovenâ€™s "Ode to Joy" as a foundation for understanding how to program melody, rhythm, and harmony.

## Objective

To create a balanced and full-sounding rendition of the most recognizable melody in history while applying music theory concepts and gaining practical experience in structuring MIDI data.

## Features

- Melody constructed from frequency and duration mappings
- Clear definition of rhythm using standardized duration units
- Harmonic support added for a fuller texture
- Foundation for future MIDI generation, playback, or audio synthesis

## How to Run

This script defines the note and rhythm structure to generate a midi file.

```bash
python ode_to_joy.py
